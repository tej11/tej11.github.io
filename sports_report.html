    <h3>
      NBA to get more involved with high school elites.
    </h3>

      The NBA is preparing to get more involved at the high school basketball level, creating a comprehensive plan that goes beyond just altering the one-and-done rule, according to ESPN‘s Brian Windhorst: Now, though, there is turbulence, as the underbelly
      in the youth and college basketball systems is being exposed. The NBA has watched it unfold. Seeing both a responsibility as the world’s leading basketball league and an opportunity to move in on valuable territory, the league is preparing to get
      involved again with elite high school basketball players, multiple sources told ESPN. Commissioner Adam Silver has reportedly met with several advisers, as well as the National Basketball Players Association, about developing a strategy that expands
      the relationship between the NBA and elite teenagers and provides an alternate path to the League besides college: But Silver’s aim is much more comprehensive than simply re-opening the door for 18-year-olds to play in the NBA, sources said. A plan
      is expected to include the NBA starting relationships with elite teenagers while they are in high school, providing skills to help them develop both on and off the court. It would ultimately open an alternate path to the NBA besides playing in college
      and a way 18-year-olds could earn a meaningful salary either from NBA teams or as part of an enhanced option in the developmental G League, sources said. Windhorst further reports that Silver could present a plan within the next few months, as the
      current scandals rocking the NCAA and youth basketball have seemingly sped up the timeline: These concerns have been on Silver’s desk for some time, and he has been seeking input on the topic, reaching out to influential basketball minds across
      the sport to hear ideas. Recent events have convinced him that some concepts need to be accelerated, sources said.

      Ovechkin eyeing to hit 50 goal mark for eighth time in career

    <p>
      No sooner had Alex Ovechkin scored his League-leading 40th goal Saturday than he had set his sights on 50. "Forty is nice, but 50 is better," the Washington Capitals captain said after he reached 40 for the ninth time in his NHL career in a 5-2 win against
      the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2018 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland. Ovechkin's chase for 600 NHL goals is the more immediate milestone in his path heading into a three-game California
      trip, which begins against the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday (10 p.m. ET; NBCSN, NBCSWA, NHL.TV). The Capitals (37-21-7) are one point ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins and two ahead of the Philadelphia Flyers for first place in the Metropolitan Division.
      He's two goals away from becoming the 20th player in NHL history to reach 600, and if he does it in his next 13 games, he would be the fourth to take fewer than 1,000 games, joining Wayne Gretzky (718), Mario Lemieux (719) and Brett Hull (900),
      according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

      NFL prospect Derrius Guice asked if he likes men during combine interview

      Former LSU running back Derrius Guice said in an interview Wednesday that one NFL team asked about his sexuality and another inquired if his mother was a prostitute at the NFL Scouting Combine that concluded earlier this week. ‘’It was pretty crazy,"
      Guice said in an interview on the SiriusXM NFL show Late Hits. "Some people are really trying to get in your head and test your reaction. ... I go in one room, and a team will ask me do I like men, just to see my reaction. I go in another room,
      they’ll try to bring up one of my family members or something and tell me, 'Hey, I heard your mom sells herself. How do you feel about that?’ " Guice said he was told "to come in prepared" for the combine and everything that comes with it. "It went
      exactly how everyone told me it would be," Guice said. "It’s exhausting. … It was a great experience. You’re being watched and tested the whole time." MORE: NFLPA leader: Team that asked prospect about sexuality should be banned from combine NFL
      spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in an email to USA TODAY Sports Thursday that the league is "looking into the matter." "A question such as that is completely inappropriate and wholly contrary to league workplace policies," McCarthy said. "The NFL
      and its clubs are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees in a manner that is consistent with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, state and federal laws and the CBA. "The league annually reminds clubs of these
      workplace policies that prohibit personnel from seeking information concerning a player’s sexual orientation." NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith told PFT Live on Thursday morning that the team that asked Guice whether he
      liked men should be banned from participating in the combine. “Find out what team did it and ban them from the combine,” Smith said on PFT Live. “The question is inappropriate. Questions along these lines are always inappropriate.” More: Analytics

      rookie Eli Apple at the combine two years ago before the former Ohio State cornerback was drafted by the New York Giants. That question came from an assistant Atlanta Falcons coach. Falcons head coach Dan Quinn said in a statement that he spoke
      to the assistant who asked the insensitive question and “explained to him how inappropriate and unprofessional this was.” Quinn did not name the assistant coach. The NFL called that exchange “disappointing and clearly inappropriate.” Messages left
      Guice's agent were not returned.
